This is a readme file. True story. 
at 1609 This file was altered on line, whilst the file was renamed on the desktop.
I hit sync after changing the name (on the desktop), but nothing changed (since there was no commit made.)
My test is to save this now, then sync to see if this content gets ported to the renamed file.
I suspect it should cause a sync error.
