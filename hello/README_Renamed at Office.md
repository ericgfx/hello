This is a readme file. True story.
<<<<<<< HEAD
alright now it is time to save and commit on PC but not sync.
=======
Okay so here it should get bloody interesting. Will there be errors? I hope so.
>>>>>>> origin/master


Aha. So the red negative is the "alright now it is..." was made locally on the PC (at a later time stamp I believe) than the Green Positive "Okay so here bloody"

Note the <<<Head local text ====(divider)=== remote text >>>>origin

So git puts these changes into the local if it were code I would assume there would be multiple <<<===>>> flags through out. Makes me think I screwed up my MOVE file from codecademy.
